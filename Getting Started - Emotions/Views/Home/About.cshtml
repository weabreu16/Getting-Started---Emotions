        The decision to create this project is that due to COVID-19, Dominican society has found
        itself involved in different cases related to mental health. When choosing a degree project,
        we wanted to create an application that, in addition to being something technological,
        impacts society in some way. A mobile application (Emotions) whose purpose is to help people
        who need the help of experts to improve their mental health, in which they can make calls with
        them and read articles published by experts in order to improve their mental health.
